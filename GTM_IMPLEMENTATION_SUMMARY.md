NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXXX

# Optional for Shopify webhooks
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. GTM Container Setup (Required)

1. Create GTM account and container
2. Set up GA4 configuration tag
3. Create data layer variables
4. Set up e-commerce event tags and triggers
5. Publish container

### 2. Testing (Recommended)

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` in environment
2. Run development server
3. Click GTM button (bottom right) to enable debug panel
4. Test events by navigating the site
5. Verify events in GTM preview mode

### 3. Production Deployment

1. Configure production GTM container
2. Set up Shopify webhooks (optional)
3. Test purchase flow end-to-end
4. Monitor GA4 real-time reports

## 🔍 Debug Features

### Development Debug Panel

- Shows GTM load status
- Displays recent events
- Test event buttons
- Real-time event monitoring

### Console Logging

All GTM events are logged to console in development for easy debugging.

### Hooks for Custom Tracking

```typescript
import { useFormTracking, useAuthTracking } from "@/hooks/useGTM";

const { trackContactForm } = useFormTracking();
const { trackLogin } = useAuthTracking();
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- Graceful degradation if GTM fails to load
- Type-safe event tracking with TypeScript
- Comprehensive error logging
- Fallback for missing environment variables

## 📱 Mobile & Performance

- GTM loads after page interactive (non-blocking)
- Events are batched for performance
- Mobile-optimized tracking
- Minimal impact on Core Web Vitals

## 🔒 Privacy Considerations

- No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) tracked
- GDPR/CCPA ready (add consent management as needed)
- Configurable data retention in GA4
- Server-side tracking option available

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### GTM Not Loading

- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID` is set correctly
- Verify container is published in GTM
- Check browser console for errors

### Events Not Firing

- Enable debug panel to monitor events
- Verify triggers in GTM preview mode
- Check data layer variables are configured

### Duplicate Events

- Normal in development (React StrictMode)
- Won't occur in production builds

## 📈 Success Metrics

After implementation, you should see:

- ✅ E-commerce events in GA4 real-time reports
